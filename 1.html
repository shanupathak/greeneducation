<h2><font color="green">Overview of the present situation of education of refugee children</font></h2>
 <p></br>

</br>

</br>

Of the 20.7 million refugees under our care, 7.9 million are refugee children of school age. Their access to education is limited, with almost half of them unable to attend school at all.

The New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants pinpoints education as a critical element of the international refugee response. Furthermore, Sustainable Development Goal 4 aims to deliver “inclusive and quality education for all and to promote lifelong learning”. 

UNHCR partners with governments and international organisations to ensure quality protective education for refugee children and young people everywhere. Together with your help, they can learn how to rebuild their lives.

Education is a basic human right, enshrined in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 1951 Refugee Convention.

Education protects refugee children and youth from forced recruitment into armed groups, child labour, sexual exploitation and child marriage. Education also strengthens community resilience.

Education empowers by giving refugees the knowledge and skills to live productive, fulfilling and independent lives.

Education enlightens refugees, enabling them to learn about themselves and the world around them while striving to rebuild their lives and communities.</p></br>

<h2><font color="green">About us</font></h2>
We help Business portfolios collaborate with UNHCR, and Refugge camps for helping young children strugging with education poverty (SDG 4). We deploy intangible resources for quality education to refugee camps in collaboration with UNHCR with structured modules and voluntary mechanism of on-boarding professionals from corporate world.There is a easy bot pop-up for quick boarding of volunteers on left.The bot instructs to follow ceratin steps thereby redirecting to a contact retrieval form required for volunteers to join.
We create educational modules so that anyone can volunteer and refer and impart education to these young children irrespective of professionaly being a mentor/teacher.The modules follow the holistic curriculum approach and the classroom takes place virtually with the help of Microsoft Azure Technology and with the on-ground open classroom approach.
